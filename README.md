# Notes
This is a web application for keeping track of your notes. When you first visit the [website](https://notes-application-1.herokuapp.com) it redirects you to Google consent screen for authentication with Google OAuth 2.0. After successfull authentication you will be redirected to the main page where you can create, update, delete and view your notes. All notes that you have created are only associated with your current authenticated Google account in MongoDB. You can also logout anytime you want. The back-end will keep your session valid for 2 weeks.
